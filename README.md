### **Warning! This game contains a lot of Bugs**
## What is in the game ?
It's a two player game. Each player can launch 10 spaceships to conquer planets which are revolving around a central star.

On each planet two numbers are written, the left number(in blue color) is the number of times the blue spaceships need to land on that planet to capture it and similarly the right side number (in red color) tells the number of times the red spaceships need to land on that planet to capture it.

When a spaceship lands on a planet, it (the spaceship obviously) is destroyed.

When a planet is captured by one of the players, it then is permanently captured and cannot be recaptured by other player.

Numbers on the top left and top right tell the number of spaceships left with each player.

Before launching each spaceship, a player can change its launch angle angle and launch velocity by the following controls:

## Controls
1. **W** -> Change launch angle of blue player upwards
2. **A** -> Decrease launch speed of blue player
3. **S** -> Change launch angle of blue player downwards
4. **D** -> Increase launch speed of blue player
5. **SpaceBar** -> Launch Blue Spaceship
6. **ArrowUp** -> Change launch angle of red player upwards
7. **ArrowLeft** -> Increase launch speed of red player
8. **ArrowDown** -> Change launch angle of red player upwards
9. **ArrowRight** -> Decrease launch speed of red player
10. **Enter** -> Launch Red Spaceship
11. **R** -> Reloads the page

## What next?
There are a lot of obvious bugs in the game. So firstly I need to fix them. And then I need to beautify it more with images, more animations,etc.
